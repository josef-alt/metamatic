# metamatic
A Python command line tool intended to find inconsistencies in metadata for audio files.
## Inspiration
I was messing with audio files and their tags when I noticed a discrepency and decided to make something to hopefully detect such errors en masse. I accomplished this task by maintaining a trie for each tag and a fall-back trie using a standard dictionary. Clustering might have been a better solution but I think tries are super cool and just wanted an excuse to use them. Also, who doesn't love Levenshtein distance?
